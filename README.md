In May 2017 Dan Wainwright [reported on which election-related searches were most popular in different parts of the country](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-39938599). We approached Google for the data on search patterns.

## Get the data

* CSV: ["Search interest in 'register to vote' by UK location over the last 7 days. All values indexed to 100, where 100 is the max value](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BBC-Data-Unit/election-google/master/BBC-%20Google%20Trends%20request%20-%20register%20to%20vote.csv)
* CSV: ["Search interest in 'who should I vote for' by UK location over the last 7 days. All values indexed to 100, where 100 is the max value](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BBC-Data-Unit/election-google/master/BBC-%20Google%20Trends%20request%20-%20who%20should%20I%20vote%20for.csv)
